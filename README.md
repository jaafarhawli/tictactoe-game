# TicTacToe Board Game

This website allows two players to play tictactoe together.
The red player starts first, then on the turn after the yellow player starts and it keeps on switching back and forth. 
The first player to match one diagonal, row or column wins.
If the boards cells are all taken and no player has won yet, the game ends in a draw.
The player who wins one game gets one point added to his score, if the game ends in a draw no player gains any points.
When the players want to reset the scores, they can press the reset button. Otherwise, they can continue playing by pressing the play again button.
